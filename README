BarButtonItemFlipAnimation
==========================

Demonstrates a very basic test case for transitioning between two full-screen
views and flipping the bar button item in parallel (like the Music/iPod app).

Obviously, this can be embellished upon by using custom graphics rather than 
solid color UIViews :)
